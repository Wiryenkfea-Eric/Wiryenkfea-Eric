## Professional Journey
I started my career in agriculture but transitioned into technology, driven by a passion for solving problems through innovation.  

Along the way, I faced setbacks ‚Äî including a failed attempt at building a startup ‚Äî but those experiences shaped my resilience and clarity of purpose.  
I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with **Alluvium**, an Atlassian and AWS Partner, which broadened my exposure to enterprise-level projects and collaboration.  

Today, I‚Äôve grown into a **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** with expertise in **AWS, Azure, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, and Linux**.  
Beyond engineering, I also serve as a **Cloud Trainer** and the **CIO of Solavise Technologies Institute** an AWS Technical partner, where I guide the next generation of tech talent.  


**Recent Projects**
- Deployed **Bitbucket Data Center** with Bitbucket Pipelines for enterprise collaboration.  
- Automated **Jira Software Data Center** deployment on AWS using Docker & Ansible (with Bastion access).  
- Led healthcare automation with **Ansible Tower**, AWS governance, and **Parameter Store**.  
- Streamlined CI/CD using **CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy**.

## Professional Interests
Nothing excites me more than seeing developers confidently embrace **cloud-native technologies** and turn their ideas into applications that are **scalable, secure, and reliable**.    
As a **Cloud Trainer** and **CIO of Solavise Technologies Institute**, I align this passion with my mission of **empowering communities through education and hands-on learning**.  

I strongly advocate for **open-source software** (even though I don‚Äôt contribute as much as I‚Äôd like üòÜ), because I believe it fuels collaboration, accelerates innovation, and lowers barriers for everyone to thrive in tech.  

At the heart of my interests is a commitment to **community empowerment** ‚Äî ensuring that knowledge, tools, and opportunities in cloud and DevOps are accessible to all, especially in emerging markets.  

## I WILL EMPOWER A GENERATION OF CLOUD & DEVOPS ENGINEERS AND BECOME THE LEADING VOICE FOR CLOUD-NATIVE

## Personal Interests
Outside the world of tech, I find joy in a few simple but meaningful things.  
I enjoy **watching and playing football (soccer)**, getting lost in **good music**, exploring new places through **travel**  and **watching NatGeo documentaries** to feel nature.
