## Professional Journey
I started my career in agriculture but transitioned into technology, driven by a passion for solving problems through innovation.  Along the way, I faced setbacks, including a failed attempt at building a startup, but those experiences shaped my resilience and clarity of purpose.   Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with Alluvium, an Atlassian and AWS Partner, designing and deploying a fully functional AWS EKS cluster within 3 weeks, implementing PostgreSQL logical replication with pglogical to ensure scalable, highly available and consistent applications, improving database reliability. Today, Iâ€™ve grown into a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with expertise in AWS, Azure, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, and Linux. Beyond engineering, I also serve as a Cloud Trainer and the CIO of Solavise Technologies Institute an AWS Technical partner, where I guide people getting into tech aligning with industry standards.  


## Recent Projects
- Deployed Bitbucket Data Center with Bitbucket Pipelines for enterprise collaboration.  
- Automated Jira Software Data Center deployment on AWS using Docker & Ansible (with Bastion access).  
- Led a healthcare application deployment with Ansible Tower, AWS governance, and Parameter Store.  
- Streamlined CI/CD using CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.

## Professional Interests
Nothing excites me more than seeing developers confidently embrace cloud-native technologies and turn their ideas into applications that are scalable, secure, and reliable.    
As a Cloud Trainer and CIO of Solavise Technologies Institute, I align this passion with my mission of empowering communities through education and hands-on learning.  

I strongly advocate for open-source software (even though I donâ€™t contribute as much as Iâ€™d like ðŸ˜†), because I believe it fuels collaboration, accelerates innovation, and lowers barriers for everyone to thrive in tech.  

At the heart of my interests is a commitment to community empowerment, ensuring that knowledge, tools, and opportunities in cloud and DevOps are accessible to all, especially in emerging markets.  

## I WILL EMPOWER A GENERATION OF CLOUD & DEVOPS ENGINEERS AND BECOME THE LEADING VOICE FOR CLOUD-NATIVE

## Personal Interests
Outside the world of tech, I find joy in a few simple but meaningful things.  
I enjoy watching and playing football (soccer), getting lost in good music, exploring new places through travel  and watching NatGeo documentaries to embrace nature.
