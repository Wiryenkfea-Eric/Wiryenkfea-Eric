I started my career in agriculture but transitioned into technology, driven by a passion for solving problems through innovation. Over the years, I’ve grown into a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with more than 5 years of experience optimizing cloud deployments and automating infrastructure.  

I have designed and implemented mission-critical systems on AWS and Azure, built CI/CD pipelines, and orchestrated containerized environments using **Docker and Kubernetes**. My expertise also includes **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform and Ansible, as well as **IT Security** for cloud environments.  

Recent Projects & Contributions 
- Deployed Bitbucket Data Center using Bitbucket Pipelines for enterprise-grade collaboration.  
- Automated the deployment of Jira Software Data Center on AWS with Docker & Ansible, including secure access via a Bastion Host.  
- Led a healthcare-focused project integrating Ansible Tower, AWS governance, and Parameter Store for compliant infrastructure automation.  
- Streamlined CI/CD delivery pipelines with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodeArtifact for faster, more reliable releases.  

Currently, I serve as the CIO of SolaviseTech, a training community dedicated to equipping African youth with in-demand skills in Cloud Computing, DevOps, Cybersecurity, and Data Science.  

Beyond engineering, I’m passionate about empowering communities, public speaking, mentorship, and knowledge sharing, helping the next generation of professionals build purpose-driven careers in technology.
